# Wecome to Support and Donate to My Channel!

Your donation and support is the motivation that I can continue working on producing technical and hardcore videos.     
Compared to the people who make only intro-level videos, this is harder and usually lead to less views and likes. And thus hard to profit from Youtube or Advertiser.
